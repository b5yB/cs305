# SNHU - CS-305

This course revolved around a hypothetical business called Artemis Financial. The goal of the course was to step into the shoes of a security consultant and solve the problems Artemis was facing. The main issue we were solving for Artemis was how we could take their distributed client-server architecture and secure their web traffic. 

The process of making code more secure was broken down into a flow chart where each aspect of the application was checked for vulnerabilities. A significant amount of time was spent on the application dependencies. Because applications rely on third-party libraries for much of their functionality, this attention is warranted. A tool we became familiar with in the course was the OWASP dependency checker plug-in. Using this tool to run dependencies against the NVD was a great learning experience, and something that I am taking with me into other projects.  

One major breakthrough I had while taking this course was a realizing how many layers there are in securing an application. It seems obvious in retrospect, and I understood pieces of this fact. But there is no one size fits all framework that can secure an application. There are layers of security which all require special attention and build on one another. It is a complex procedure and we are standing on the backs of giants.
